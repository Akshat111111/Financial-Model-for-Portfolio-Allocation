# Introduction

The Black-Litterman model, developed in 1990 by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman at Goldman Sachs, is a mathematical model used for portfolio allocation. The model was designed to tackle challenges that institutional investors faced while applying the modern portfolio theory (MPT) in practice [Source 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Litterman_model).

# Development and Methodology

The Black-Litterman model begins with an asset allocation based on the equilibrium assumption, which suggests that assets will perform in the future as they have in the past. It then modifies this allocation by considering the opinion of the investor regarding the future performance of the assets. The model is based on the MPT, which posits that an investment's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone, but should be evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio's risk and return. The Black-Litterman model improves upon this by incorporating observed market data along with investors' projections of future expected returns [Source 0](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/black-litterman_model.asp), [Source 1](https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/modern-portfolio-theory/black-litterman-model/).

# Recent Developments

The Black-Litterman model has evolved over time and has been widely respected within the institutional investment community since its creation. The model has been used not only for bonds but also extended to equities and currencies. Furthermore, recent extensions of the Black-Litterman model have incorporated elements like linguistic information and the views of multiple experts [Source 11](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-42972-4_5).

# Advantages

The Black-Litterman model allows investors to derive portfolios that reflect their views, without resorting to arbitrary constraints on portfolio composition. This model enables portfolio managers to incorporate their market views in a way that approximates how they actually think about their outlook. It also provides a robust framework for portfolio optimization, allowing investors to balance risk and return in a way that aligns with their unique views and expectations [Source 0](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/black-litterman_model.asp).

# Disadvantages

Despite its many advantages, the Black-Litterman model has limitations. Because the model incorporates opinions on future outlook, these projections are merely opinions or the result of pricing models that rely on subjective inputs. Therefore, the Black-Litterman model may result in bias or incorrect assumptions. For instance, an overly-optimistic view of one asset class will result in having greater portfolio weight than MPT would recommend, and if that asset class falters can result in magnified losses [Source 12](https://www.toolshero.com/financial-management/black-litterman-model/).

# Conclusion

The Black-Litterman model has had a significant impact on the field of portfolio management. Despite its limitations, it continues to be a powerful tool for portfolio optimization, providing a comprehensive framework that allows investors to balance risk and return in alignment with their unique views and expectations. As with any financial model, users of the Black-Litterman model should be aware of its potential pitfalls and adjust their expectations and portfolio weights accordingly These points of view are integrated into equilibrium returns, as well as the uncertainty matrix.
As a result, the stated opinion that MSFT would outperform GE by 2% is not completely factored into a difference in expected returns of 16.1% - 15.7% = 0.4%.[Source 0](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/black-litterman_model.asp), [Source 12](https://www.toolshero.com/financial-management/black-litterman-model/).
