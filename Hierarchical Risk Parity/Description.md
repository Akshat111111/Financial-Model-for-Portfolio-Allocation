# Introduction
This project explores a novel approach to portfolio optimization known as Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP). The HRP technique consists of three primary stages: Tree Clustering, Quasi-Diagonalization, and Recursive Bisection. The final segment of this project involves a comparative analysis of the HRP method against traditional portfolio optimization techniques.

# Objective
The HRP method diverges significantly from conventional portfolio optimization techniques, offering new insights into the intricacies of this discipline and providing a more realistic perspective on the challenges faced by quantitative researchers. 

# Findings
Key performance indicators such as Maximum Drawdown and Sharpe Ratio were employed to compare the HRP technique with conventional methods such as the Method of Uniform Weights and the Minimum Variance method. The results indicate that the HRP technique outperforms these traditional methods on most parameters [Source 1](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2708678), [Source 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7072/11/1/10), [Source 8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02728), [Source 9](https://ideas.repec.org/p/war/wpaper/2020-21.html), [Source 11](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290331), [Source 14](https://riskfolio-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hcportfolio.html).

# Revised Description
This project delves into the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) method, a relatively novel approach to portfolio optimization. The HRP technique is comprised of three main stages: Tree Clustering, Quasi-Diagonalization, and Recursive Bisection. The project concludes with a comparison of HRP against traditional portfolio optimization techniques. The HRP method offers a unique perspective on the intricacies of portfolio optimization and presents a more realistic view of the challenges encountered by quantitative researchers. Performance indicators such as Maximum Drawdown and Sharpe Ratio were used to compare the HRP method to conventional methods like the Method of Uniform Weights and the Minimum Variance method. The results demonstrate that the HRP method generally outperforms these traditional methods on most performance indicators.
